            There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the
            other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again. Suddenly
            she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden
            key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the
            locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the
            second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about
            fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
